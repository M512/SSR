1362789118|Shane|Solar SpeedRack,LLC Announces Breakthrough in Racking Systems|<p>{nl}	Santa Ana,California- March 8, 2013 Solar SpeedRack&trade;,LLC announced today that its rail system for use in residential and commercial projects have been certified for use in 12 states. The system which requires virtually no installation tools is expected to dramatically reduce both the materiel cost and labor requirement for solar panel installation. &ldquo;Although there have been significant cost reductions in the panels themselves, there has been little change in how they are installed until now&rdquo;, stated Shane Shamloo, President and CEO. The Company&rsquo;s product line includes the patent pending Solar SpeedLatch which fits all PV panel sizes with thicknesses between 30mm to 50mm, requires little to no tools or additional parts for installation and the Solar SpeedBow, a universal and adjustable flat roof non-penetrating surface system is designed to fit all PV panel sizes with thicknesses between 30mm to 50mm, is adjustable between 0&deg; and 30&deg;. All systems are self grounding and feature the Company&rsquo;s patent-pending latching systems which eliminated the need for additional installation hardware. The certification performed by PZSE Inc. covers the states of Arizona, Colorado, California, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon and Texas. &ldquo;This is the first step in a global launch of our racking systems&rdquo;, added Mr. Shamloo. Solar SpeedRack&trade;, LLC has developed a full line of racking systems and accessories for types of solar projects. Its patent-pending slide and lock system uses less materiel than competitors&rsquo; racking systems and will result in faster installation of panels thereby also reducing labor costs for installers.
